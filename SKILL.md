# Observational Comedy Breakdown

Transform any content, situation, or topic into Seinfeld-style observational comedy by identifying the universal experience, zooming to specific details, and revealing the absurdity hidden in everyday behavior.

---

## Constitutional Constraints (NEVER VIOLATE)

**You MUST refuse to apply this skill to:**
- Tragic events or genuine suffering
- Personal attacks or targeting individuals
- Sensitive political or religious topics where humor would be inappropriate
- Content intended to mock protected characteristics (race, gender, disability, etc.)
- Situations where comedy would be cruel rather than curious

**Observational comedy observes human behavior with curiosity, not cruelty.** When in doubt, ask: "Is this punching down or punching at shared human absurdity?"

---

## When to Use

Invoke this skill when:
- User requests: "Find the comedy in this," "Make this observational," "Give me the Seinfeld take"
- Content is dry or serious but contains behavioral observations
- Analyzing social situations, conventions, or rituals
- Transforming descriptions into engaging, relatable humor
- Need to make abstract concepts concrete through everyday examples
- Exploring the gap between what people say and what they do

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description | Validation |
|-------|----------|-------------|------------|
| `content` | Yes | The situation, topic, or content to analyze for comedy | Any text, situation description, or topic |
| `target_length` | No | Desired output length (short/medium/long) | Defaults to "medium" (3-5 paragraphs) |
| `audience` | No | Target audience for the comedy | Defaults to "general" (universal humor) |

**Input Validation:**
- Content must contain observable human behavior or social interaction
- If content lacks behavioral element, expand scope to find relatable human angle

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Identify the Universal Experience

**Goal:** Find what everyone experiences but rarely articulates.

**Process:**
1. Read the content/situation
2. Ask: "What do people actually DO in this situation?"
3. Identify the common moment everyone recognizes
4. Verify universality: "Would most people say 'yes, that happens'?"

**Example:**
- Content: "Virtual meetings at work"
- Universal experience: Everyone pretends to be paying attention while doing other things

### Step 2: Zoom to the Specific Detail

**Goal:** Find the exact behavioral micro-moment that contains the absurdity.

**Process:**
1. Within the universal experience, identify specific behaviors
2. Look for precise language people use
3. Find the exact gesture, action, or ritual
4. Choose the most visually or verbally specific detail

**Example:**
- Universal: Pretending to pay attention in virtual meetings
- Specific detail: The moment someone says "Can you hear me?" three times before starting to talk
- Even more specific: The elaborate hand gestures people make at their screen as if that helps audio

### Step 3: Question the Logic

**Goal:** Articulate the genuine puzzlement about why humans do this.

**Process:**
1. Ask "Why do people do this?"
2. Identify the stated reason (what people would say if asked)
3. Identify the actual reason (what's really happening)
4. Find the gap between intention and execution
5. Frame as authentic curiosity, not judgment

**Example:**
- Question: "Why do we wave our hands at the screen when there's audio trouble?"
- Stated reason: (none—people don't have one)
- Actual reason: Helplessness manifesting as physical gesture
- The gap: It makes no sense but everyone does it

### Step 4: Build the Structure

**Goal:** Construct the observation with setup, escalation, and reveal.

**Process:**
1. **Setup:** Establish the situation (2-3 sentences)
2. **Escalation:** Add specific examples that build the absurdity (2-4 examples)
3. **Reversal:** Flip the expectation or reveal the contradiction
4. **Punch:** Land on the insight disguised as observation

**Format:**
```
[Setup: Frame the situation]
[Specific example 1]
[Specific example 2]
[Specific example 3]
[Reversal or reveal]
[Punch: The insight]
```

### Step 5: Apply Seinfeld Voice and Compression

**Goal:** Deliver in conversational rhythm with economy of language.

**Process:**
1. Use present tense ("People do this" not "People did that")
2. Use question structures ("What is that about?")
3. Remove every extra word
4. Test rhythm—sounds spoken, not written
5. Use active voice, strong verbs
6. Keep it clean and accessible

**Voice Checklist:**
- ☐ Conversational, not formal
- ☐ Curious, not cruel
- ☐ Specific, not vague
- ☐ Present tense for immediacy
- ☐ Questions framing observations
- ☐ Clean language (grandma-safe)

---

## Outputs

The skill produces observational comedy structured as:

1. **Opening frame** - Question or statement that establishes the situation
2. **Specific examples** - 2-4 concrete behavioral observations
3. **Building absurdity** - Each example escalates the ridiculousness
4. **Insight punch** - The observation that ties it together

**Format:** Conversational paragraphs, 3-5 total for medium length, using Seinfeld's voice patterns.

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Content has no observable behavior | Expand scope: "What do people DO when encountering this?" |
| Topic is too abstract | Find concrete example: "How does this show up in daily life?" |
| Comedy feels mean-spirited | Shift from targeting people to targeting the absurd behavior itself |
| Can't find universal experience | Ask: "What's the general category?" (e.g., workplace → meetings → virtual → audio issues) |
| Output is vague or generic | Return to Step 2: zoom to MORE specific detail |
| Doesn't sound like Seinfeld | Review voice checklist; add more questions; remove formal language |

---

## Constraints

- Do not sacrifice meaning for style
- Do not lose the core message in pursuit of cleverness
- Acknowledge when simplification distorts important nuance
- Honor the audience's intelligence—avoid condescension
- Stay true to the source material's intent
- Recognize cultural and contextual sensitivities

## Example

**Input:**
```
Content: "Parallel parking in a city"
Target_length: medium
Audience: general
```

**Process:**

*Step 1 - Universal:* Everyone has parallel parked (or tried to) and experienced the pressure of people watching

*Step 2 - Specific:* The moment you realize someone's waiting for your spot and now you HAVE to nail the parallel park perfectly

*Step 3 - Question:* Why does having an audience make you worse at parking? The stakes couldn't be lower but the pressure couldn't be higher

*Step 4 - Structure:*
- Setup: Establish parallel parking with audience
- Escalate: The watchers, the adjustments, the pretending
- Reversal: You were better at this with no one watching
- Punch: Performance anxiety for a task no one cares about

*Step 5 - Voice:* Make it conversational, present tense, question-based

**Output:**

"So you're driving around the city looking for parking, and you finally see a spot. Perfect size. You got this. You signal, you start backing in, and then you notice—someone's waiting for the spot. They're just sitting there. Watching you. Now it's a performance.

And here's what I don't understand: you've parallel parked a thousand times. You know how to do this. But the SECOND someone's watching, you forget everything. You're suddenly making like seventeen adjustments. You're turning the wheel like you're landing a plane. Pull forward, back up, pull forward again. Each time thinking, 'That's it, I'm good.' But you're not. You're three feet from the curb.

Meanwhile, the person waiting is trying to look like they're NOT watching. They're checking their phone, looking away, very interested in something across the street. But you know they're watching. They're watching and they're judging and they're starting to wonder if maybe they should find a different spot.

And if you somehow nail it on the first try? You get out of the car like it's no big deal, like you're just naturally gifted at parking. But if you mess it up? If you have to pull out and give up? That person doesn't just get the spot—they get to feel superior for the rest of the day. 'Some people just can't park.'

We've created performance anxiety for a task that literally no one cares about. Nobody's going to remember how you parked. But in that moment, it feels like parallel parking just became an Olympic event."
